Nobody asked for my feedback. 
I thought that you guys had enough to work on.  Not Good

We are missing the Check-In page. 

So, for Monday please do the following:
1.	Add the check in page. 
2.	After login – we should see 3 tiles. 
o	Monthly Meeting Check-In. 
o	Personal & Professional Goal Tracking
o	Financial Metrics
1.	On the Personal and Professional Goal tracking. 
o	Drop down selection for each Month – 3 colors (Red, Orange and Green)

Thanks,
